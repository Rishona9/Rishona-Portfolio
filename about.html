        <p class="paragraph-about">
          I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio and live with my husband, our
          yellow lab Bella and our tiny cat Olive. I've lived in Colorado and
          South Florida and have been fortunate to have done some traveling
          around the world, spending time in Italy, Ireland, and Israel to name
          a few.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-about">
          In my free time, I enjoy reading murder mysteries, working outside,
          developing my coding skills, eating great food and running. I am an
          avid runner and have run two marathons and a handful of half marathons
          to date.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-about">
          I received my Master's degree in Speech Language Pathology and have
          worked with both children and adults in a variety of settings. I am
          currently the Lead Speech Language Pathologist at a rehabiliation and
          long term care center for adults. I have enjoyed providing patient
          care to help others improve their lives, educating families, working
          on interdisciplinary teams, and leading others in my position.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-about">
          I am so excited to have found the world of coding and have immensely
          enjoyed learing and developing my coding skills over the last 7 months
          through SheCodes Workshops and now through Treehouse. Next up, Full
          Stack JavaScript Certification!
